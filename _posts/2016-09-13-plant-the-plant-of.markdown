Experiencing that "distant feeling" in your relationship with your Lord?  In all honesty, we can all answer: "YES!"  It happens to us all, & the Lord Who knows all about the one caught in that relationship rift wants to "Word-Fix" it!  He helps us to close that undesired distance with an Ezekiel excerpt from His Word: "And I will raise up for them a plant of renown" (Ezekiel 34:29).  As God's physical laws are decreed to do the job, so do His spiritual laws, and they work wonderfully well when the soul of man has his heart set on them.  Praise the Lord, Who has raised up the One, namely Jesus, Who can then raise us to the spiritual place of "fellowship-close!"  The "Plant of renown" desires a glorious growing place in your life!  Raise Him up and He raises you!  Lift Him high by glorifying Him!  Then grow tall, grow mature, grow stately with Him and in Him as He gains His rightful place in a nurtured spiritual life!  The reaping: His glory will fill your soul when that growth happens - THE PLANT CAN GROW IN YOU! The result: you now have that rebounding relationship - ABOUNDING, and God reveals it ALL to you.  Ezekiel tells us so: "Thus shall they know that I the LORD their God am WITH them, and that they ... are my people saith the LORD God" (v. 30).  May the LORD be WITH you as you allow Him to "plant the PLANT OF RENOWN" AND GROW AS THE PLANT GROWS IN YOU!
