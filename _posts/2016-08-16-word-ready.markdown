 Need some "in the Word motivation?"  Important?  Absolutely!  The reason: when we get in the Word; the Word gets in us.  Jesus tells us His words are spiritual and they are life (John 6:63).  Yes, we can enjoy "life in the Spirit!"  Here's how, by being in the Word:   "Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O LORD God of hosts" (Jeremiah 15:16).  When we "find" the Word, we find ourselves - in personal-joyful  relationship with the Lord.  That JOYFUL FIND brings a "oh so" personal relationship with our Lord, because He adds a wonderful  spiritual dimension to our lives.  Jeremiah tells us that we are "called by thy name" - His name is a name above all names.  What a "getting in the Word motivator!"  All because of a beautiful, personal relationship with the Lord calling us by HIS NAME.  An in the word communication with Him begins with a name connection with Him - His name bonded together with our name, and that brings life in the NOW!  BTW, He knows your name already, so let's be Word ready, allowing Him in bringing close His name, connecting with our's; what a spiritual energizer, His spiritual motivation, calling us by HIS NAME,  enabling us  to be in the Word.  A Word-ready life is LIFE READY!
