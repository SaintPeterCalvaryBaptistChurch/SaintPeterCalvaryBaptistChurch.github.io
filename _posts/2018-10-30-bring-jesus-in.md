"Never man spake like this man" (John 7:46) were words spoken by those who were sent to "bring in Jesus!" These words were in answer to the jealous religious leaders who wanted to silence Jesus.  The Pharisees & chief priests asked, "Why have ye not brought him" (v. 45)?  There was a surprising answer given at that self-made religious tribunal, spoken by Nicodemus.  Interestingly, he was one of the officers present, but he was the spiritual spokesman standing alone who identified himself with the message and ministry of the Christ.  "Never man spake like Him!"  It wasn't too much earlier in Scripture that the Lord revealed to this perceptive Pharisee the heavenly truth: "Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God" (John 3:3).  Nicodemus heard the glorious news of Jesus' teaching on how sinners are brought to Himself, & then to heaven; consequently, he had little interest in the question "Why have ye not brought him?"  Well, Nicodemus had already brought Jesus in, in his soul now, being born again in the Spirit.  When the most important salvation question is answered, the inquiries from the unsaved religious crowd matter little!  May the "Man, who never spake like this Man" speak His Word to your heart today, and "bring Jesus in" a little closer in your born-again, Spirit-filled walk with Him!
