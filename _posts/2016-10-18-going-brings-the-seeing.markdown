Desiring an up close, personal view of your Lord enabling that "once again" beautiful-joyful walk with Him?  He is not so distant as we might presume, that is, from the seeing heart of obedient faith.  A close look at the invitation to His disciples to meet up with Him speaks volumes on "closing the distance!"  It's all a spiritual matter of: "I'll do what you want me to do Lord & go where you want me to go!"  Here's the scripture that makes all the difference & takes care of all the distance concerning your seeing Him in your life today & everyday.  "Then said Jesus ... go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me" (Matthew 28:10).  Faith that follows the command of the Christ leads to the coming to Christ, in a  face to face visual of the One we long to see "up close!"  Jesus is still speaking to the brethren (that's us): "Go to me & you shall see me!"  Going brings the seeing!
