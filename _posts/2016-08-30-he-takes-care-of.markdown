Need some spiritual fuel to fulfill your God-given purpose in life?  Is that "old familiar feeling" of "is it worth it all" trying to sneak into your heart's door?  No need to listen to that intruder.  Oh, there is no "lost cause" when it comes to the child of God living for God.  Invite His voice coming to you today with the assurance of the words: "I'm for you, I'm backing you, just keep living for Me!"  Personal power is on its way from our God, & that spiritual energy can be poured into the soul of man, including your's!  God has designed an everyday power-assist coming from Him to you, all backed up with His Word, reaching you with the majestic magnitude of His name:  "Their Redeemer is strong; the LORD of hosts is his name: he shall throughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the land" (Jeremiah 50:34).  As He is strong in the redemption of your soul,  He doesn't leave you powerless, He continues giving day by day strength as the "LORD of Hosts" to "plead your cause!"  The blessing: "If God be for us, who can be against us" (Romans 8:31).  When we walk in His powerful name, He pleads your cause, and a life rested is your's!  Commit your cause to  Him, and He takes care of the REST.
