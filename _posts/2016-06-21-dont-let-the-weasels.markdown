Feeling that plague of guilt lately? Is missing that mark of perfection capturing your attention & taking away your joy?  Let's address this all with a question; "How much is good enough in our standing before our righteous, holy God?"  The answer is found in the question, it's all about our righteous God, and it's His righteousness that becomes our's as believers.  The Psalmist tells us so: "Hear me when I call, O God of MY RIGHTEOUSNESS" (4:1).  An old 18th century hymn nails it down because of Calvary's nails: "Jesus thy blood and righteousness, my beauty are my glorious dress."   In a prophetic prospect, Job knew what was needed in his guilt-ridden soul: "My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live" (27:6).  He knew his Redeemer liveth (Job 19:25), and Job would come to the understanding that no guilty reproaches should weasel their way in to steal away the joy of HIS life lived within.  Oh, that "glorious dress" from our righteous LORD: do wear it, do walk in it, do  live with it, and do rejoice in it because "in these arrayed, with joy shall I lift up my head!" Ludwing von Zinsendorf  / circa. 1739
