"Struggling to maintain that fellowship with our Lord?"  Since that relationship is spiritual in nature, we have a great spiritual asset: His nature within, a divine nature. We are "partakers of the divine nature" with His "divine power that pertains to life and godliness" (2 Peter 1:3-4).  Still struggling?  Fellowship with Him comes gloriously to you by His "grace multiplied" (v. 2).  Still struggling?  That grace is "unto you" (directional - in LIFE, His to your's).  Still struggling?  This verse sends the Reinforcer: "God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto (directional, toward you) the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord (1 Corinthians 1:9).  The grace of our Lord brings you into a fellowship with Him, maintaining & making His divine powerful call to that fellowship with Him.  Still struggling?  You don't have to anymore!  Just answer the call!  When our faith-walk is weak, He is faithful and makes us faith-strong with His grace-filled fellowship working with your divine nature within! Yes, it's time for a grace-filled walk, listening to HIS CALL all along the grace-filled way!  Still struggling?  "I don't think so!"
