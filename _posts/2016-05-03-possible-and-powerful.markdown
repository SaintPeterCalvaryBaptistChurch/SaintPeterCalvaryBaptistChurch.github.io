Have you thought to yourself lately, "Things don't look so good!"  Then along side of that despair came the words within: "Looks to me like an impossible situation!"  Oh, take heart, because the dreary things change with His Word spoken within & that soul's overcast of your's is chased away with the Son-look that Jesus gives to you and upon you: "And Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible" (Mark 10:27).  So true!  With God "ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE!"  Allow Jesus to be "looking upon you" (v. 27), because when He does, he looks also upon those impossibles (as we view them) intruding their wormy way into our lives. With His look redefined as our's & with His new look captured in our now focused spiritual sights, we see the possible linked together with the powerful.  Both HIS and from HIM!   It's all a matter of dealing with how we look at life's situations.  Allow his "looking upon you" (v. 27),  tied together with His view of our difficulties, and you will have a new OUTLOOK, all empowered by faith rewarded with His powerful possibilities. "Got any rivers uncrossable? Got any mountains you can't tunnel through? God specializes in the impossible! He does things we cannot do! Take that new look through the eyes of the Lord.
