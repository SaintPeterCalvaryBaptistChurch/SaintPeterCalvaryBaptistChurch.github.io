Hopes up? Will the right person be elected to solve the problems in a divided nation? Will things then get better & will our country then get back on the path for national prosperity? Yes, we need real answers and long for viable hope; however, the real hope for man is not found in any elected position held by man. Yes, men in office espousing godly principles in government can and will make a difference for our land, but the ballot box was never the panacea for our real well being! The real difference comes with a vote from the heart for One Who governs all & is over all. "Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles" (Isaiah 42:1). Mark your ballot for "mine elect" & and allow His judgment to be your "soul's delight!" Remember He is sovereign & He rules the nations, no matter who man puts in office! Yes, "He shall bring forth judgment ..." (v. 1).  Rest your hope in the One Who knows how to rule! By the way, HE WILL!  "He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations" (Psalms 66:7).
