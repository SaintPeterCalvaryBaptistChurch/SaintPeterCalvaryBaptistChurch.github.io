Merry Christmas to all!  Christmas can be just that: Merry, even in a world of sin, and in our most imperfect personal world.  Along side of that festive merriment, Christmas time often generates within us the sadness found within us all; those reflected, sometimes-dark memories do speak to us - vividly.  Well that's why Christ came to proclaim conquest of that which wants to conquer us.  No more darkness & death!  Light & life comes from Him and becomes of us IN Him!  The Prophesied One can reign over it all, including evil and the evil one: "I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel" (Genesis 3:15).  Jesus came to destroy the works of Satan (I John 3:8), and He comes to you with the reign of the kingdom of God in our sin-tainted world.  Where Jesus reigns, His kingdom authority is present - in your life.  Those invisible powers of rebellion against Him and His are rendered powerless and cannot harm us.  We are one, unified with Him in salvation. "Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ" (I Corinthians 15:57).   He comes to you this Christmas to crush the head of the one who wants to crush you.  It's not going to happen, because He came, and a Merry Christmas happens to be your's!
