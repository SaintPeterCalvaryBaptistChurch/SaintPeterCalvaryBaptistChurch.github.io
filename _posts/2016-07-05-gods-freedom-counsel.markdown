Any challenges lately?   Any internal struggles?   How about this question, "How goes the battle?"  Yes, as believers, there is a wrestling match within that soul of our's.  This is where the "FREEDOM COUNSEL" of the LORD comes with the declaration of victory.  The Psalmist was given that counsel, "He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me: for there were many with me" (Psalm 55:18).   Freedom is given in the struggle & peace of soul is granted by the One Who brought the delivering power punch in the battle against your soul.  Here's some good news to the spiritual, born-again believer!  When we live for Him, "the battle is the LORD'S" (I Samuel 17:47).   Freedom is such a priceless gift, yet costly because it involves a price that needed to be paid for the one living free.  "Jesus paid it all!"   Being spiritually free brings an heighted awareness to the One who paid the price of the soul set free.  Oh, live there with that spiritual perception and daily appreciation.  Jesus declared man's independence from sin's sovereignty governing him at salvation's cross, and as we live in His Spirit, we are living in the greatest freedom known only to the redeemed.  Jesus proclaimed, "If ye continue in my word ... ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free" (John 8:31-32).  Continue there, and you'll be FREE THERE!  Just abide by HIS FREEDOM COUNSEL!
