Need a blessing from the Lord today to keep that spiritual engine of your's in tune? As an obedient son to His loving Father we all can rest assured that His goodness to be bestowed is well on it's way.  He has the heart to give the blessing, the power to deliver it, & the authority to make it real!  It's all about the Father's "special order" blessing for His obedient children. Ordered?  Absolutely!  Here's the order-power found in the Word to deliver that blessing that we all desire from our Father:  "The LORD commanded the blessing, even life for evermore" (Psalm 133:3).  With an appreciative look at all the blessings coming from the Lord, as seen in the entirety His Word, and a closer look at today's text, there is a "blessedness of being blessed" for you.  The real blessing accompanying the blessing is "Life Forever More!"  Blessed people are full of life because they are living in the blessing and the blessed state of their Living God.  Oh dwell in the blessed submission of His Spirit & to His Word; as you do, you have the blessing of His Life commanded to you, His blessed  Life for you, & His Life to be lived in you, all in the blessed state, HIS -  with you today & everyday - that translates into Life Forever More.
