Want that "closer walk with Him?" Feeling that the Lord is not as near as He once was to that 'longing for fellowship heart' of your's?"  Going to the Word is the answer to that relationship, getting us back to spiritual newness with His Holy Spirit life.  Here's the Word: "Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; that glory may dwell in our land" (Psalm 85:9). Nigh is what our longing heart desires, nigh to Him, nigh with Him, and nigh for Him. The "nigh answer" is found in the Psalmist's two words: "fear Him" in our salvation experience. Reverential respect for Who He is, and what He has to say (His Word), will "repair the rift" and bring us nigh! Want that?  Here's the spiritual reward: "that glory may dwell in our land!" A glorious NIGH in relationship with Him and in our local church fellowship spiritually happens as we "repair the rift!" Come to the "NIGH" by a commitment to the fear, His fear, the fear of the Lord. Respecting Him and His Word.
