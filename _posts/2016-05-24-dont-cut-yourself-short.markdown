 Been "cut short lately?"  Could it be that what was meant to be for you never made it to your person & place in life?   Hopefully that "cutting short" possession wasn't occurring in your spiritual realm.  It did happen to some Old Testament "shortsighted" & self-willed  people who "short-cutted" their relationship with their God & "took no heed to walk in the law of God" (2 Kings 10:31).  The tragic result:  "In those days the LORD began to cut Israel short" (v. 32).  No blessings, no prayers answered, no divine interventions; all because of "NO WALK WITH HIM!  Thank God for that revival breaking forth back then.  All because down deep in the heart of man, some of the people of God hunger for the Word of God and His activity in their soul,  as seen in the context.  Things changed when "Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD ... and the people , that they should be the LORD's people" (11:17).  Oh, the Lord has promised His blessings upon the lives of those who are His people walking with Him, praying to Him, living for Him, serving Him, faithful to Him, speaking for Him, worshiping Him, in your place of fellowship together with the "people of God" ALL FOR HIM.  Oh, don't cut yourself short of what was meant for you. "No good thing will He withhold from them that walk uprightly (Psalm 84:11). All for the people of God - oh, be one of them!
