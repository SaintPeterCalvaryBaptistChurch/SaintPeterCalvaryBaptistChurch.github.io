Exhausted, tired, worn out in the walk, namely in your spiritual walk?  Would you believe that there can be rest for our soul as we go forward one step at a time in a Word based faith-walk!  It begins with what the Lord says about that faith-walk & the place on which our faith is positioned!  We walk by faith in practice, by holding on to the Word of faith in position, namely doctrine.  There is a challenging verse that can bring a rest-full walk into faith's practice: "Thus saith the LORD, stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls" (Jeremiah 6:16).  Once we stand there, we can ask there, then when we ask there with a heart interest, we can see there.  Once we see there, we can believe there: then, seeing is believing, and believing is to "be living!"  It's all about  the old & proven paths that God's people of old have trod, and the Word documents that path as the "GOOD WAY!"  May it be said, "yes, that 'Old Time Religion' that was good enough for our fathers and their fathers is good enough for me!"  Why? because t's more than a religion, it's a relationship with our Lord, and He gives rest in the walk!   May the Lord remind you from Jeremiah's encouragement that you can rest while walking with Him & that walk is the "Good Way!"  "FEELING REFRESHED WHILE WALKING!"
