Ready for that new day? Is the spirit of the day keyed with a glorious prospect waiting for you?  It can be & it will be if our Sovereign Lord is at the control helm.  Your new day can begin with His "oh so ever new" promise: "Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the LORD is risen upon thee" (Isaiah 60:1).  We can be "up & going"  people of God, READY FOR THE NEW DAY He has given to us!  SHINE READY can be our soul's garment to wear with His glory upon us as we allow His light to COME upon us.  His light dispels the darkened gloom of the soul, chases away the stifles of the spirit, and brings in a new visual of a new you (2 Corinthians 5:17)  to tackle the day.  His light is the essential ingredient for the re-creation of soul & spirit to TAKE ON THE DAY!  The light of His word, His will, His way is waiting to shine upon you. Oh, His light is so vital for your walk.  Bring HIS SHINE IN  by bringing Him IN - close: "Walk in the light as He is in the light!" A shining result: "we have fellowship one with another" (I John 1:7). Rise & shine!
