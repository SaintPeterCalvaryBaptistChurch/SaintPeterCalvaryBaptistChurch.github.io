Waiting for that windfall of earthly treasure to carry you through this needy life of our's?  The wait is over: for REAL TREASURE that is! Now is the opportune time to gather the real treasure into our storehouse, as Scripture brings His Word-wealth into our spiritual focus. Here then is the Lord's wealthy windfall of His life-sustaining treasure: "Wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times, and strength of salvation: the fear of the LORD is his treasure" (Isaiah 33:6). The real Treasure is the Lord & the wealth that He imparts: wealthy wisdom to chart your life, wealthy knowledge to manage your life; wealthy stability to handle your life, & wealthy strength of salvation to enjoy HIS life. His treasure house is connected to and overflowing into the hearts of those who cherish a rich and everyday abiding in Him. The real windfall? The fear of the Lord!  Make His treasure your treasure!
