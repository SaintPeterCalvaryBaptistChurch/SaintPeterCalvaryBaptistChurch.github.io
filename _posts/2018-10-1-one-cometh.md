As spiritual born-again believers, we long for those hidden, golden truths "still out there" for us to discover in the Word, and then grow in the Lord. One of those valuable secrets was not so secret with John the Baptist. His heralding call was: "He must increase, but I must decrease" (John 3:30). The spiritual formula is so simple, yet profound: "only the emptied vessel can be filled!" John's beholding was "the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world" (1:29). It's all a matter of beholding Jesus, and the salvation He brings to redeem man. Btw, salvation is more than being saved, because Jesus also "takes away" the power of sin as we behold him in a cleansed walk with Him (confession of sin - 1 John 1:9). Oh behold Him! When sin and self will take their exit in our personal walk (our decrease), we can enter into His fulfilling fellowship, His increase. He brings His life-giving flow to our soul. Behold Him! It's all a matter of allowing the greatness of God to permeate your soul. So, the secret is out: "after me COMETH A MAN which is preferred before me" (v. 30). Who He was to John and what He meant to him in his beholding Jesus, is offered to us. That is why the record of John the Baptist still resonates: "Behold the Lamb of God." When the beholding comes, HE COMES! He comes in His greatness: in His power & His presence because of His preference.
