Any anxieties, apprehensions or other fearful notions knocking on the door of your desired peaceful habitation?  Yes, that emotional "life-changer" wants in, and your address is marked well on the enemy's GPS.  Here's the blessing: the real "Life-Changer" wants in, and the powerful peace of our Lord exceeds that futile fear trying to erode with its influence on our hears and minds.  His name is Jesus, Who does still the waves, namely those storm-filled treacherous concerns!  He stands as Our Victor at the bow of our ship of faith, & calls us to spiritual action, namely trading in the human-held fear for Spirit endowed faith in His power to still the waves. Scripture time is marked time for the failing heart: "And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm" (Matthews 8:26). Just look to Him, long for Him, and LOVE HIM.  It is faith that worketh by love (Galatians 5:6), and  that powerful loving faith taps in to the ONE Who is the LIFE CHANGER. "There is no fear in love: but perfect love casteth out fear" (I John 4:18). Allow the ONE Who COMMANDS THE CALM, to give you that love-filled faith, as He stands at the bow of your ship - TODAY!  "Then He arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea and there was a GREAT CALM" (v. 26).
