Before us today is a title with a verse, and a message: "The Attraction of One!" Jesus prayed the following prayer: "That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me" (John 17:21). This intercessory prayer of Jesus is regarded by many as the original "Lord's Prayer!" In it is portrayed, not only a close "oneness" relationship of the Father with the Son, but also the oneness of "those which thou gavest me" (v. 6), as well as "those which shall believe on me through their word'" (v. 20). Jesus is emphasizing a oneness with Him, for all believers to become united in the power of the Holy Spirit, and then one with another. Then, the attraction of the Gospel is empowered with that oneness of His Spirit: "that the world may believe that thou has sent me." Here's the message: those who do not yet know the Lord have an interesting perception: they are on the "look out" for a people of God that are united in Spirit with Jesus. Walking in the oneness of His Spirit, and then with others brings the attraction of the gospel of the One, for others to be won unto Him, and then to be one with Him. As we live in one Spirit & speak of Him concerning His glorious gospel, the oneness grows with God's spiritual mathematics. Lets be the one to multiply the oneness!
