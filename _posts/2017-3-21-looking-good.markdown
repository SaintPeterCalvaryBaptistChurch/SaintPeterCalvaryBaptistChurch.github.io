We have heard it so wonderfully & so wonderfully often, namely, the phrase "God is so good!"  That goodness of God is more than a statement, it's a life changer.  His goodness is so real, and so personal; in that, His goodness that is directed to us changes us, powerfully within.  When acknowledged, received, and appreciated, our whole internal spiritual structure comes alive, knowing that "I can live with the goodness of God perspective ON my life."  That's how the Lord views our life, and so can we.  Knowing that the good things that God has for us make their way to us, well, that goodness definitely gets into our soul.  "INTO THE SOUL?"  Oh, yes, that's exactly what the Lord has designed for us all.  Scripture tells us so: "behold ... know in all your hearts and IN ALL YOUR SOULS, that not one thing hath failed of all the GOOD things which the LORD your God spake concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, and not one thing hath failed thereof" (Joshua 23:14).  When we have a fresh new looking into the Word, WE VIEW our lives are "looking good" as we are walking in obedient fellowship with our good God, Who gives us the GOOD in LIFE. Take a new look at the old book, and see "the goodness of God outlook" that we can all enjoy in life.  Live in that goodness today:  LIFE'S REALITY is that there is "the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living" (Psalm 27:13).
