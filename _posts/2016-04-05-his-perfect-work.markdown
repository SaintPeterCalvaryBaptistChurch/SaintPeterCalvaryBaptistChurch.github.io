Have you ever wanted that "perfect" walk with the Lord, all the while realizing "it's not in me" & and there is no perfection on this side of glory.  Scripture to the rescue: "The LORD will perfect that which concerneth me" (Psalm 138:8). Here's the encouragement: "It is IN you, because He's IN you!" As the Lord dwells in the born again believer, & as the Christian abides in Him, He identifies Himself with His glorious perfect LIFE within.  Instead of the relentless striving in order to achieve that unattainable spiritual plateau, His love lifts us up where we belong in our walk with Him. You may say in all honesty, "but what about 'who I really am?'"  Oh, let's not forget the Psalmist's conclusion on that matter, found in the same verse: "thy mercy, O LORD, endureth for ever!"  His perfect work never stops in bringing us to a perfect walk even when we fail!  HIS PERFECT WORK NEVER STOPS - He's the One working His perfect-pleasurable work in you (Philippians 2:13). It's a JOY-WORK, and He is the One Who will not "forsake not the works of thine own hands" - Yes all found in the same verse - for you (v. 8). Find yourself there, in the perfect Word, with the PERFECT LORD, for a perfect walk - His with you.  Enjoy that walk with Him in you today!
