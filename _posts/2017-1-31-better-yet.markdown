The wonderful blessing of the Christian life is that "you're not in it alone!" Better yet, He alone is all you need to take that next step forward in faith as He lives within you. "Ye are complete in Him" (Colossians 2:10).  The believers of old recognized that very spiritual intriguing fact:  "And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest" (Exodus 33:14).  Better yet, as He lives His life within, you can live out His "rest-enjoined life" by grace. "For thou hast found grace in my sight" (v. 17).  Better yet, as you allow the Lord to exercise living grace with His presence within, you live out that life  with Him on a first name basis: "I know thee by name" (v. 17).  A life in Him, by Him, and for Him doesn't get any better than that.  Yes, your relationship with the Lord is a "BETTER YET" life, second to none when discovered when His "presence shall go with thee."  The Lord makes it so, and He tells us so: "The Lord said ... I will do this thing" (v. 17).  Let Scripture come alive with His life. Walk with the Lord today and everyday.
