Here's a blessing from Scripture being sent your way: "Unto you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities" (Acts 3:26).  Yes, Jesus came to "bless you!" God sent Jesus with the prospect of the redemptive blessing sent to you! The spiritual connection for the blessing to be our's has a qualifier, mankind must have a personal heart disconnect from that which thwarts the blessing.  Blessed be our forgiving Lord, & blessed be the forgiven, repentant sinner.  What a "heaven sent" - His Son & our sonship (I John 3:1).  Oh, walk in that forgiven state of fellowship to continue to receive & enjoy more of the blessings sent from the Son sent!  Make it an "Unto you first" (v. 26) blessing, by making Him first in your life!
