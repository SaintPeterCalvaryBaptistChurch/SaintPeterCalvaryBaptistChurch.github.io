Bewildered in your becoming more like your Lord?  Desiring that close walk with Him, but losing that spiritual connection?  Lost in the translation of Word becoming the living compass, pointing true north in your life?  No need for your dismay, even the most spiritual among those who have gone before us had their tough times forging ahead.  Case in point, consider Mr. Job:  "Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him" (Job 23:8).  Oh, those initial feelings concerning our spiritual grade point average need a new reflection on how the Lord interacts when we are in our spiritual fog.  Job found that truth certain as the Lord came strong to him with His Word.  The answers to life's questions, direction, & on time arrival are summed up in God's final say in the matter: "He knoweth the way that I take ... for he performeth the thing appointeth for me; and many such things are with him" (vs. 10, 14).  Yes it's all about faith vs sight, knowing and following the One who sees the way when we cannot.  "But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise" (Malachi 4:2).  May being bewildered BE NO MORE,  BECOME of Him as the Son arises and burns off the spiritual fog!
