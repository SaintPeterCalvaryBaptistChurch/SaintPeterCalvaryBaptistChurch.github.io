We have all heard it: "life's not fair!"  Even Scripture conveys to us that injustices happen to the righteous that belong to the unjust man (Ecclesiastes 8:14).  Before we throw in the towel, being engaged in this spiritual fight of our lives,  please consider the righteousness of our God: HE  KEEPS SCORE:  "I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him" (Ezekiel 21:27). Life may not be fair, but our God  is, and He takes care of all the injustices that draw their unwanted & intrusive target on our lives. A triad of overturns (v. 27)  coming from the One is on its way.  It is our JUST GOD Who also brings  the right, AND BRINGS IT ON to the one to whom it belongs. "Let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap if we faint not" (Galatians 6:9).  Concerning the RIGHT, THE LORD TELLS US, "I will give it him!" The JUDGE of the earth lowers the gavel and pronounces "CASE CLOSED - THE RIGHT IS YOURS!"
