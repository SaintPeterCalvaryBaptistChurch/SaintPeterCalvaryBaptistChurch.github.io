Need some extra spiritual muscle to grace that life of your's during those tough, even tearful times. They do come to us all, don't they?  Well, then it's time to look to our Lord to take care of that soul's need of strength, as we find our way back to the starting gate of our daily walk and run with Him.  Everyday strength is God-sent, delivered to the one living the life that God has called us to.  Life "in Him" is all about Him.  An up & running life is found in His life: grace-favored, grace sent, grace delivered, all leading to a grace-life that is joy-strengthened!  The Word tells us so:  "In his favor (grace) is life: weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning" (Psalm 30:5).  Yes, JOY COMETH!  He gives it; we don't have to chase it. It comes to us when we come to Him and live for Him.  We don't have to limp along when we possess God's spiritual grace-muscle of joy. The joy of the Lord is your strength (Nehemiah 8:10).  Here's our joy assignment: Get JOY-STRONG in the WORD-STRONG FOR THE JOY-WALK: "Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and long-suffering with JOYFULNESS" (Colossians 1:11). Yes, then "JOY COMETH!"
