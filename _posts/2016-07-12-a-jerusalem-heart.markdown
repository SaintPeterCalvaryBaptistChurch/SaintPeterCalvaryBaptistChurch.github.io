 "How's that life's scenery look around you & about you?" " What about that portrait of your life's setting?"   The answer always will  be contingent upon the picture drawn, portraying both the who & what is in that setting.  Well, for starters,  let us all ascribe to the Biblical canvass with His fortified spiritual colors detailed in place, to enhance that view about you & around you. We have our LORD, as ONE Who gives us the strength, security, and standing that every life needs; yours included:  "As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the LORD is round about his people from henceforth even for ever" (Psalm 125:2).  Take another look "round about (your) Jerusalem," a Biblical look, that Jerusalem place where the Lord will reign supremely (Jeremiah 3:17).  Those mountains are solid, and aren't going anywhere; they're not on the move, they are there to stay.  The answer to a secure, solid standing in life is to allow the Rock of all ages to reign supremely in your life.  One word: Lord (Master, surrender your heart to Him).  Then, take another look with your Lord (supreme, sovereign ruler) "round about you" with the answer of strength speaking within you, to live your life with His power of LIFE. How's that scenery look now?  Life is powerfully secure with a JERUSALEM HEART, the place of His honorable throne!
