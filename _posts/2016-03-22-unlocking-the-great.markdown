Heard it lately, wished it for another lately: "Have a great day!" We all want that day, & we all can all possess that day. Yes, "having" a day so great, so inclusive in it's very definition makes life living to its fullness.  Here's the spiritual key that unlocks the great day door.  We just can't have a great day; that great day has to be given to us in order for us to live it, and it begins with our Great God: "Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; and his greatness is unsearchable" (Psalm 145:3).  That great day comes to us in a day lived in fellowship with our great LORD, a day lived greatly praising Him, all the while finitely limited in our seeking His infinite greatness.  Oh YES, there's always more of Who He is to us in greatness well on its way.  When that great day comes to us from our GREAT GOD, we can then enjoy the Psalmist's heart reflection as our own: "This is the day which the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it' (Psalm 118:24).  Have a great day! Better yet: May a great day come to you, a day that the LORD has exclusively made for you as you live in His greatness, rejoicing and being glad in it.
