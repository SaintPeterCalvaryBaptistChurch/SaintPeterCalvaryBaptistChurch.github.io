 Any struggles lately? How about those awesome responsibilities that seem to bring the hammer down on your entire existence?  Well, back to the Bible we go.  As we dwell in the Lord, He goes with us through it all, giving us respite on the way: "And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest" (Exodus 33:14). Notice the Person doing the speaking of that rest: He said it! His powerful Person issuing forth most powerful words, truly spoken, and it's all related to His presence. Walk with Him today & everyday and the toils of life won't make a toll on your life. "For we are laborers together with God"  ( I Corinthians 3:9). He with us, and we with Him.  When "He's in there with us," you are NEVER ALONE!  Oh, dear child of God, REST IN THAT MOST POWERFUL TRUTH.  Duties then become delights when there is His rest in everyday responsibilities.
