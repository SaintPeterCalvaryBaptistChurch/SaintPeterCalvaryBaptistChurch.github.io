 Loving that job of yours? It's a glad day at work when the task is fitted to the one enjoying his calling in life!  Now, how about that spiritual work that the Lord has so gloriously designed, tailor fit for you?  "Loving that work in you?"  Here's the answer from the Psalmist, the one walking with the One - at work in his life: "For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work" (Psalm 92:4).  Yes, we can make the gladness-connection with God "through His work" in us!  When we do, our Christianity is victoriously transformed, full of His joyful life. The Psalmist tells us so: "I will triumph in the works of thy hands" (v. 4).  His glad work in you is then spiritually fit for us to fulfill our calling in life! "For it is God which worketh in me both to will and do of his good pleasure" (Philippians 2:13). Make the "GLADNESS CONNECTION" with His work in you!
