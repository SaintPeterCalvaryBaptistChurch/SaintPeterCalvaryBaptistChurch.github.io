Need some rain?  The spiritual rain of God's blessing can be poured out on "your land" & the showers of His can be your's!  Here's the "how" and it deals with the "know" in following the "Shower Maker!" Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the LORD: his going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth" (Hosea 6:3).  His "going forth" has a direct parallel in OUR PERSONAL GOING FORTH in following the Lord.  His rain of blessing in the healing of our soul and the binding of the same Is WORD INCLUSIVE, all dealing with a revived HEART (living in him again life - v. 2).  Question: "How sure is this promise of an abundant life in our Lord?"  The answer from Hosea is clear & certain: "Thy judgments are as light that goeth forth" (v. 5).  His Word does and will go forth!  You can't put out the light & you can't stop HIS rain as you go forth in following Him! "Then ye shall know" (v. 3).  Get out the umbrella!
