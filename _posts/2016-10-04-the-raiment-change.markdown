Like what you're wearing?  Dressed for success?  How about appreciation for the garb of spiritual success? The Lord can help us answer those questions of personal decor. He has the spiritually attractive garment that "fits all" & it is spiritually fashioned for all!  When we wear His robe of white given at salvation, be Biblically assured that it will never go out of fashion - it's eternal. The designer garb from the Great Designer is your's for the wearing: "And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment" (Zechariah 3:4).  The raiment change is ready for all who enter His redemptive dressing room.  The changed raiment comes from the One who can change the one desiring the "new look"  of the "new man" (Ephesians 4:24).  The new  spiritual garb will catch the eyes of the one who knows what to wear!  As we wear it, "we shall walk with HIM in white" (Revelation 3:4).
