Have you found THAT what you have been looking for? Still chasing that elusive rabbit of happiness?  Those dreams, plans, desires, & all those self-perceived ideals that convince us, telling us that they can bring us happiness & joy of heart!  Well, with good intentions aside; let's prayerfully allow God to speak from the Joyful Life Manual.  If we do, we will discover real joy: "Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD" (Psalm 105:3).  Only the LORD can create a rejoicing heart within; man cannot.  His rejoicing is for you; however, it's all a matter of Who, where, & what we place in the cross-hairs of our targeted heart search.  Oh, glorify His holy name by seeking Him in faithful fellowship in your local Bible-believing church on Sunday morning, seek Him by reaching out to those needing salvation in your personal gospel ministry, seek Him by praying fervently, seek Him by being filled with His Spirit, seek Him by sharing His spiritual life with others; yes, seeking Him in all things. The spiritual equation: Seeking Him always brings rejoicing - always. Let that rabbit of elusive happiness well enough alone. God never orchestrated joy from him anyway.  Glorify Him by seeking Him, and get ready to enjoy those God directed plans & dreams with His rejoicing!
