There is no greater news than the gospel "good news" of God "so loved" (John 3:16). God so loved and continues so in that love every moment of everyday - loving YOU! When we are honest with ourselves concerning who we are, in and of ourselves, we must pose that most inquisitive "why?" "Why does He love me so?" The answer is found in Who He is, and not in who we are. Here is the Word that tells us so: "the LORD did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number ... but because the LORD loved you" (Deuteronomy. 7:7-8). The plain & simple, yet profound answer is: He loves you because HE LOVES - YOU! A divine love indeed, beyond our human comprehension. A love, His love, that qualifies those living in that supreme love "to be a special people unto himself" (v. 6). Yes, in our humanity we may try to understand the "why" of His love; but instead, look to the "Who" of who He is (God is love -I John 4:8), then walk in the Spirit of that love (Galatians 5:16), and "so love" others with the fruit of His Spirit: love ... (Galatians 5:22). God's love makes the difference in lives because He "so loved." Oh, be so involved with His love, because He "so loves" in His involvement with you! Enjoy being loved and then being loving as the one "special unto himself above all the people upon the face of the earth" (v. 6).
