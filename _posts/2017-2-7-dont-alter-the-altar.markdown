Longing for the return of that captivating, youthful joy experience of life.  We all had it, and God gave it - THAT JOY OF LIFE!  Yes, we can all "remember when!"  If maybe that joy experience is history, could it be that the "return" is all about our return in a devoted close heart-contact with the One Who can give us the joy of life - restored.  The Psalmist tells us how that youthful joy becomes our's once again. "O send out thy light and thy truth: let them lead me; let them bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles" (Psalm 43:3).  Being led to His truth place brings a joyful living in His rejoicing place, namely His presence: "Then will I go unto the altar of God unto God my EXCEEDING JOY" (v. 4).  It's all about an altar, namely an elevated place of our offering our heart in truth to God, and He in turn offers His exceeding, light-filled, sustaining joy of life.  Your heart was created by Him and for Him to experience the joy altar!  No substitutes, no added ingredients, no alternatives, no other altars please. Don't ALTER THE ALTAR found in His joy place. Be youthful in joy again as a child of God living in His presence, and allow Him to give you that JOY OF LIFE RESTORED!
