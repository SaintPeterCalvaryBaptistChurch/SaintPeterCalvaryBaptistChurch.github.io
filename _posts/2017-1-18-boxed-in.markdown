Struggles anyone? Oh, the burdens of life & those intense testings come to us all. Tough personal encounters are part of life as we make our journey on this side of glory.  Here's the blessing: you're not in it alone.  Scripture tells us that God sees, God hears, & God knows:  "And the LORD said, I have surely SEEN the affliction of my people ... and have HEARD their cry ... for I KNOW their sorrows" (Exodus 3:7).  Our loving God does not leave His children bereft His personal, providential involvement, especially when He finds us "boxed in" our life situations.  As visualized in the Grand Exodus of the Children of Israel out of Egypt's bondage, He "brings forth His people" (v. 10).  The added blessing:  when delivered, God tells us all, "Ye shall serve God upon this mountain" (v. 12). Those struggles weaken their grip on our lives as we are led by the Exodus hand of God, Who leads us to a place above it all to reveal His glorious work in us and among us. "He knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold" (Job  23:10).  Yes, He delivers, He then leads us to the mount of His oversight, and we see our lives refashioned as a golden experience. Struggles anyone! Make your life a golden opportunity for God to be at work!
