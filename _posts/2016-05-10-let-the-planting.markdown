Let the planting begin! It's all about sowing in the now and the reaping to certainly come.  The Word of God is clear; what a  man sows he will reap (Galatians 6:7 ).  Then, what a harvest: the sower turned reaper accrues manifold more than his initial deposit in that soil of life.  As for the seeds for the sower, oh select them carefully and with great prospect!  As for the harvest, it can be a time of rejoicing.  Oh, allow the Lord to choose His right seed, and allow His right Spirit to condition and prepare your right soil.  A joyful harvest is then all in the making, that gladness of heart guaranteed to you, backed up with Scripture:  "Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart" (Psalm 97:11). Let the light of the Lord be turned on in the happy heart of his people & let planting begin (with His seeds of course)!
