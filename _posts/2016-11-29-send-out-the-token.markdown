Looking for something good to come your way?  Wait no longer!  The Biblical answer is that His good has already come; however, just as the Lord understands our need for spiritual assurance, He answers the request of: "Shew me a token for good" (Psalm 86:17).  Here are some tokens for good revealed in His Word, coming your way: 1) He hears us Psalm 86:1,   2) He preserves your soul v. 2,   3) He rejoices your heart v. 4,   4) He doeth wondrous things v. 10,   5) He teaches you in the way v. 11 & the list goes on.   The result: there is some goodness that can NOW come from us, GOODNESS OVERFLOWING, going His way, all from a heart that has harvested His goodness!  There is a spiritual response coming from a heart that cannot retain all the goodness that has come our way. That response: releasing our token for good back to the One Who gave it all in His redemptive goodness. Send your token for good His way today:  "I will praise thee O Lord; with all my heart; and I will glorify thy name forevermore" (v. 12).
