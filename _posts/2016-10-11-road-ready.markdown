Ever traveled in the fog?  It's not our choice driving experience of going somewhere; that is, until the sun rises & burns off that visual inhibitor.  How about going somewhere in that unwelcomed spiritual fog, with all those intense feelings of internal direction lost?  There is a Light that can burn through it all so we can see where we are headed once again.  With the power of His Word shining forth, we are "Road Ready" - out of the fog;  going & growing again. "But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow ..." (Malachi 4:2).  The Lord desires to do the "healing" of the spiritual engine of your life, get you on the road of life again, going somewhere in destinations divinely determined.. The key to starting that engine of life is given "unto you that fear my name" (v. 2).  Oh, love the Lord, serve Him, fear Him, and then watch Him do the fog burn!   "In thy light, we shall see light" (Psalm 36:9).  Road ready begins with being Word-ready!
