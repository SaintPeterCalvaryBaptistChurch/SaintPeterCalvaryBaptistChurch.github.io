In the hunt for that  proverbial treasure you hope to be your's someday?  Waiting for that ship of your's that just may finally come in?  Wait no more, hope no more,  & look no more!  The most precious & lasting valuable possession that can ever be your's, Is YOUR'S already! The qualifier: being a repentant sinner, a born-again child of God, saved by the precious blood of Christ. "But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us" (2 Corinthians 4:7).  His purchase of your salvation by His blood precious brings in the treasure precious. As the purchased price paid is so precious, so is that treasure within the heart of the purchased, redeemed believer. A TREASURE PURCHASED "with the precious blood of Christ" (I Peter 1:19).  No man is a poor man who has the real treasure of Christ & His redemptive gift-work.  When we have Him and His treasure, it's a glorious possession: "Ye are Christ's" & "all things are your's" (I Corinthians 3:21, 23).  Yes, "all things!" Try sizing up the meager possession of a ship coming in or a treasure hunt to THAT!
