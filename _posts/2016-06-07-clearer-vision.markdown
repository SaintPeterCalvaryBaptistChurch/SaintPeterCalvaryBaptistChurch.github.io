How are things looking lately?  Are we thrilled with the sights set before us?  Is "bleak" the comeback word from pending, looming despair!  If so, the answer just may be emanating from the eyes of our humanity, that part of us that "LIFE HITS HARD!"  Oh, there's clearer vision - from our Lord.   Every moment in life is precious, and we must take time to view that life through the eyes of faith. "For we walk by faith, not by sight" (2 Corinthians 5:7).  Things change in the faith walk because our view of life has a different perception in the faith walk.  The reason: faith taps us into how the Lord is overlooking it all with His divine purpose in view.  Oh, take another look at your life with His look UPON you in your life!  See as He sees - YOU!  He sees all of YOU; He's looking over it, all for YOU;  He lovingly works it all out to the good purpose of His will for YOU when we love Him in our faith walk (Romans 8:28).  Faith tells us so, and faith's walk leads us so,  and faith helps us to view that which the Lord has specially designed for this who "walk by faith; and not by sight!"  That's clearer vision, seeing as He views it all! Take another look, in faith!  "The LORD will perfect that which concerneth me" (Psalm 138:8).  Praise the Lord, it's not so bleak after all!
