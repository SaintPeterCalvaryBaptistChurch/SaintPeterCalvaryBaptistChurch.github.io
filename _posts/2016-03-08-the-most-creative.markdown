Being loved and then feeling loved is the most creative wonder that the heart of man can experience! That love begins with the Author of love, "God is love" (I John 4:8), and "God so loved" (John 3:16).  You may ask; "but why?"  We are all tainted with a sinful heart.  "How could He ever love me?"  The "why" does He love is addressed in the Scriptural "Who" of that love.  "The LORD ... set His love upon you ... because He loved you" (Deuteronomy 7:7-8).  Yes, so simple yet so profound; He loves you because He loves you.  With the God of that love filling our hearts with His Holy Spirit power (Galatians 5:22), the redeemed can feel special in that love!  His Word declares it so: "the LORD thy God hath chosen thee to be a SPECIAL people unto himself, above all people" (v. 6).  Being loved and then feeling loved is man's greatest need fulfilled; that love brought Jesus to the cross to redeem us. Once redeemed, allow the creative wonder to begin, all because of love we can live in that love, HIS LOVE. The WHY?  All because OF THE WHO, He loved you because He loved you! Oh, that love takes care of so many things in that which we call LIFE!
