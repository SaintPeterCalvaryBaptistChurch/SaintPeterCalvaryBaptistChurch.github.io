 We have all heard the "age-old" advice: "Don't spread yourself too thin!"  When you "go with God" it's not going to happen!"  Fellowship with Him is KEY, and walking with Him is so rewarding; and, then assembling with God's people brings the added Biblical blessing: "It shall be, if thou goest with us, yea, it shall be, that what goodness the Lord shall do unto us, the same will we do unto thee" (Numbers 10:32).  The goodness of God is waiting for you!  Where?  In the fellowship of God's people!  Go there, be faithful there, serve there, share in a ministry of outreach there, and then be expectant there!  Why? "IT SHALL BE, what goodness the Lord shall do" shall be done "unto thee!"  God's goodness received from one is given to another, because "he goest with us!"  Be there to spread the goodness when the Lord gives it to you, being in the fellowship God has called you to!  Don't spread yourself too thin with all those activities keeping you from THE GOODNESS PLACE and the goodness that God sends to the fellowship. "YEA, IT SHALL BE - IF THOU GOEST WITH US!"
