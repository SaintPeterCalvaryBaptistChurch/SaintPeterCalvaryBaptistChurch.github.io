"What's in a name?"  That's an interesting question calling for interesting answers.  Take the name Jabez for example, concerning that Biblical question & answer study!  Jabez, the name speaks of "sorrow!"  There is a life-changing decision that he made; he didn't live according to the name given him; rather he lived up to what the Lord could give him.  Scripture tells us so in his prayer:  "Jabez called on the God of Israel, saying, Oh that thou wouldest bless me indeed, and enlarge my coast, and that thine hand might be with me, and that thou wouldest keep me from evil, that it may not grieve me! And God granted him that which he requested" (I Chronicles 4:10).  Here's the life-changing challenge: take what life has placed on your plate, lift it high in a Jabez prayer with all its Jabez misgivings, and be ready to receive a Jabez answer: "Granted!"  Life's too short for sorrow too long.  Get the blessing for you, the coast enlarged before you, God's hand on you, evil chased from you, and the granted request coming at you.  Be a Jabez, not in name, but a Jabez in being blessed!
