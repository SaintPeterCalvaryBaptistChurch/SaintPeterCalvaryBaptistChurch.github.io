Need some encouraging thoughts concerning the direction you're headed?  Well, if we have chosen the Lord's compassed heading; we can be fortified with His thoughts about you and that road you're on: "For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end" (Jeremiah 29:11). Need that cherished expected end, together with the personal assurance of the Lord paving your pathway with peace leading you there? Just take the Jeremiah #29 road for the divinely mapped-out direction that leads to the right destination, capitalized with the insignia called the "EXPECTED END!"   You can expect to reach that place if you abide in His place, all the while enjoying His thoughts of peace projecting youward on the Jeremiah road #29.  That road is Word inclusive: "If ye abide in me and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you" (John 15:7).
