Hungry? How's that appetite of yours?  May this question be addressed to us all: "May I take your order please?" Better yet, the One who can bring what we need to the table is telling us all, "May I take your order?" "Please allow Him!"  The Lord has something hot off the spiritual menu to take care of a man-sized longing for a full-plated meal.  Here's the verse: "if ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land" (Isaiah 1:19).  What is so interesting is the  meaningful link between a spiritual longing and the blessed reward of the "good of the land" to be given.  It's not a question of "feast or famine" anymore when it comes to serving the Lord with a "willing and obedient" heart.  The Lord promises to take care of the craving needs of His own.  The Psalmist David used the pen of God to assure us:  "I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread" (Psalm 37:25).  As we address "Our Father who art in Heaven" and ask Him "to give us this day our daily bread," may our prayer also be with the "willing and obedient" heart that desires "thy will be done" in our lives.  Let's allow Isaiah to bring it all to spiritual reality, "Say unto the righteous, that it shall be well with him; for they shall eat the fruit of their doings" (3:10). "Your order please?"
