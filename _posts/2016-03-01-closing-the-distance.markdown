 "Too distant?" We want to address that "at times" sunken feeling that you may have, when your personal relationship with Him needs too come a 'bit closer?  Yes, your desire is to muster up all of those spiritual ingredients to make your "walk & talk" with Him to be close, but in our heart we know that we just don't "have it together" on our own!  How true!  God created us for Himself, and that molding of our clay has the ingredient of dependability on Him and His Word.  That's when and why we look to Him for the spiritual answers, and understand that we all need an ample supply of His Word-powered encouragement.  With our hearts "Spirit-ready," the Lord tells us He is "Scripture-ready" with what He has to say: "For what nation is there so great, who hath God SO NIGH unto them, as the LORD our God is in all things that we call upon him" (Deuteronomy 4:7).   With His Word then brought close in heart, He closes the distance with HIMSELF-SO-NIGH as "THE LORD OUR GOD IN ALL THINGS!" He brings Himself "SO-NIGH-CLOSE" in fellowship with those who bring His Word "So-NIGH-CLOSE" in their hearts.  Let the LORD close the distance today in your walk & talk with Him "IN ALL THINGS!"
