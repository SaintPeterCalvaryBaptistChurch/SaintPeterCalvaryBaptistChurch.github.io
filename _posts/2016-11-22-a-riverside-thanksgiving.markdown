Prayer & its place in the Christian life is so essential, so true during this Thanksgiving season. Believers back in Bible times had a time & place for their heart conversation with their Lord:  "We went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made" (Acts 16:13). They journeyed "out of the city" getting away from all its distractions & gathered by the peaceful place of the riverside.  What an example to follow, & what a time of year to pray & to give thanks to our Lord: "seeing He giveth to all: life and breath, and all things" (v. 25) . Find time at YOUR riverside place this Thanksgiving, a place without all the distractions of "the city" clamoring for your attention.  Find  that peaceful place, express your thanks to God for all His blessings bestowed on you & your loved ones!  Experience a RIVERSIDE THANKSGIVING this year!
