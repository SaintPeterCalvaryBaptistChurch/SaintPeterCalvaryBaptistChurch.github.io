May the Word, and through His Spirit, together with His bountiful blessings make this day memorable to you and your's. Remembering that thanksgiving begins with Him! "Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift" (2 Corinthians 9:15). There are no words "speakable" to express the gift of salvation, but an attempt at needful thanks spoken is certainly the order of the day and every day. The Word reminds us that His giving does not stop with salvation, neither should our thanks giving. The reason: "being enriched in everything to all bountifulness which causeth through us thanksgiving unto God" (2 Corinthians 9:11). The bounty from God with His Spirit filling us with thankfulness (Ephesians 5:18, 20) works through us, initiating the hearty cause for thankfulness in return. Then, the real bounty of spiritual enrichment from thankfulness will make our Thanksgiving, as His Spirit remakes us in His Spirit of thankfulness - all for His glory! "For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God" (2 Corinthians 4:15). Have a glorious, Happy Thanksgiving as we are all filled with His Spirit of heart-felt thanks.
