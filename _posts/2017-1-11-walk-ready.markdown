The spiritual walk of God's children is not without its unique setbacks, struggles, & situations, sometimes bewildering.  Unique?  Yes, indeed, unique to extent that a setback in the will of God can be redefined into a powerful, grace-given setting forth.  There is a difference that GRACE makes, a life-changing difference.   God's living & lovingly bestowed grace gets us all up and going again. DIVINE FAVOR does the job; He tells us so:  "And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me" (2 Corinthians 12:9).  When the strength in your spiritual legs diminishes, and those legs are ready to give out, He gives us a total replacement. Along with the pain of our infirmity comes His strength and healing, making us  "walk ready" for the long stretch.  With the power of the Word, we can "GLORY ON"  as we walk on.  Replacement anyone?  Once you had it done by Him, you will wish you have done it earlier.  There's no pain in taking the 2 Corinthian 12:9 walk.
