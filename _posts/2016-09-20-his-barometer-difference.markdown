Any words coming at you & to you that are making the difference, affecting the "internals" of your life.  The penetrating difference that words make (even your words) can be the barometer difference between "going on" or "giving up" in life.  Isaiah has the right Word for the right time, for  right thinking - for us. "O LORD, by these things men live, and in all these things is the life of my spirit: so wilt thou recover me, and MAKE ME TO LIVE" (Isaiah 38:16).  Question: just what were "all these things" that gave "life of the spirit" to the prophet?  Oh, those words of His, those God's Words, were words of life giving spirit that made the barometer difference to "recover" Isaiah, & will get you going again as well.  Here then, are THOSE WORDS: "What shall I say? He hath with spoken unto me, and Himself hath done it" (verse 15).  What the Lord says, He will do: dictum factum (whatever is said is DONE)!  That means you can "Do Life!"  As Isaiah pondered, "What shall I say?"  The response:  our pondering is history, only one answer remains: nothing can be spoken or added when the Lord speaks Life giving words to our soul.  His Word power gives us life power - to keep us keeping on.  Jesus tells us: "The words that I speak unto you the are spirit, and they are LIFE" (John 6:63).  He can make the barometer difference; go on in your life giving challenges and "DO LIFE"  today!
