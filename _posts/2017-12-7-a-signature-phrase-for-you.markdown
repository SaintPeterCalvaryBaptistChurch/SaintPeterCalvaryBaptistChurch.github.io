SURPRISED? It is probably no "eye opener" to the "beloved" in the Lord that
real, honest, genuine love is missing in so many relationships. It doesn't have
to be that way. God has plenty of "agape" love (God's love - I Corinthians 13)
to "go around!" Let's send ourselves to the Biblical narrative of the Lord
meeting with those with whom He loved. Oh, picture yourselves there and let your
heart build upon the love that Jesus had to share with those needing God's love.
"Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples whom Jesus loved"
(John 13:23). Unique to the Gospel of John is this "signature phrase" of
identification, as given by John under Holy Spirit inspiration. Cherished are
the reasons for that "personally ascribed love," & those reasons for the words
of divine intimacy are many as they come to mind! May they then resonate within
our hearts, holding dear the love of our Lord. John knew that Jesus loved him;
he personalized the love that Jesus had for him, & he wrote the phrase "whom
Jesus loved" emphatically (4 X) throughout the Gospel (13:23, 20:2, 21:7, &
21:20). Could the real reason for the emphasis of those "chosen" words from
John's authorship be that as they originated from Holy Spirit inspiration, those
living, life changing words are meant to be appropriated by us all. "Whom Jesus
loved" was written by God in John's Gospel for the "all whom Jesus loved!" "For
God so loved the world" (John 3:16); that's you and me (the very ones who need
it placed ALIVE in our souls). God has assigned your personal I D to be the one
"whom Jesus loved!" Here's our mission: "Keep yourselves in the love of God"
(Jude 21). Make it a signature phrase for you: "the disciple whom Jesus loved."
When we receive that love from Him and keep ourselves in His love, we can share
it, just like Jesus shares it with us.
